# ML_Project_CINF104

In this repository we shows the results obtained from our research work on the prediction of electric current consumption using neural networks, time series and the ARIMA and RNN models.

We use the "reporte_interruptores.csv" dataset for our research, we made a few changes to it so that it was easier for us to manipulate columns and the data they contain.
